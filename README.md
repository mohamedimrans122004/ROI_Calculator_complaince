## Detailed File Description

### index.html
- Main HTML page providing input fields for business parameters.
- Includes buttons to calculate ROI, reset inputs, or save scenarios.
- Links all assets (CSS, JS, images) for a complete frontend experience.

### plugin.php
- Contains backend logic to process input data.
- Performs calculations such as:
  - **Total Savings** = Cost reduction per invoice × Number of invoices
  - **ROI** = (Total Savings – Automation Cost) / Automation Cost × 100
  - **Payback Period** = Automation Cost / Monthly Savings
- Returns calculated values to the frontend.

### assets/css/
- Stylesheets to make the UI responsive and visually appealing.
- Example: `style.css` for main styling, `responsive.css` for mobile view.

### assets/javascript/
- Adds interactive functionality:
  - Form validation

2. Inputs business parameters (e.g., invoice count, cost per invoice, automation cost).  
3. Clicks the **Calculate** button.  
4. JavaScript captures input and sends it to `plugin.php`.  
5. PHP calculates:
   - Total savings
   - ROI percentage
   - Payback period  
6. Results are returned to the frontend and displayed in a user-friendly format.
